# Reflection

## regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
I think my accuracy is improved in some aspect, I can now write code quicker with higher accuracy. However, there are still something I can do to further improve myself, like eliminate repetition and simplify my code.

## regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
It's important to leave comment in some code and name the variable in format.

## regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
Maybe allow student to make up the quiz in one day after the due date will be helpful.
